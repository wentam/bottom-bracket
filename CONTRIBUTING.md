Due to the license, values, and funding model of this project, a CLA is required for contributions.

Annoying, but necessary because:
  * I need to be able to uphold the values of the project
  * I need to maintain the ability to change the license to something more open if I decide to.
  * I want to keep the option open of funding this project through commercial licensing if the
    project grows to the point where that would be relevant.

I'm not trying to exploit contributors, but trying to maintain the ability to uphold certain values
and possibly fund what I view as a community project. As evidence to this, note that third-party
implementations of bottom-bracket (under their own licensing) are explicitly permitted and encouraged in the
license.

See CLA.md.

In your pull requests, please state the following:

```
I have read and agree to the [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](CLA.md).
I am authorized to contribute this code under the terms of the CLA.
```

By submitting a pull request, you agree to the CLA.

Thanks for jumping through the hoops!
